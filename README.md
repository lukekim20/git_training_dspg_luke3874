# Intro to git for DSPG

- `git init` : initializes a repository
	- only type this once, do not 'nest' your repositories
- `git status` : tells you what is is going on

- *this* is italics, **this is bold**

- `git commit -m "hello"` will let you commit

# Branching in Git
- use `git branch MY_BRANCH_NAME` to create a new branch
- use `git checkout MY_BRANCH_NAME` to go to that branch.
- look at where things are with `git log --oneline --all`

# add with master branch
